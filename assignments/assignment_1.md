# Assignment 1

# Installing Python

Please follow installation instructions from this tutorial: [https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444). Download version 3 of Python (not version 2). It is easiest to select 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable' in step 2 (this will allow you to run Python from any folder on your computer).
 
The 'Anaconda' version of Python contains everything you need to run Python code, and it also contains ‘Jupyter notebook’. This allows you to organize/run Python code on your computer through a web page.

## Required

Write a Python program that asks for user input (ask the user to enter a number), and determine if that numer is a prime number or not. 

Your program needs to reject the user's input if the user does not enter a number.

See [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp) for an example to get user input.


> Note: data entered may be of type 'string', and may need to be converted to 'int'. 

> You need to think about how can you test if some division gives a round number or not.


Please submit your python code along with the output of the program in HTML format.

# Use web resources

There are lots of resources on the web to help getting Python to do what you want. Use Google to search for queries like 'Python input number', or 'Python test for equality'.
