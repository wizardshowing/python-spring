# Assignment 7 - Matplotlib

## About Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library that allows you to make (beautiful) graphs and figures in Python.

## First

Before working on this assignment, read the following:

- [Tutorial how to use Matplotlib](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python)
- [Another tutorial (more advanced)](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial#bar-plots)
- [Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html), to get inspiration

## Glassdoor.com

[Glassdoor](www.glassdoor.com) is a website where employees can leave reviews (anonymously). For example, reviews for EY can be found at [https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/EY-Reviews-E2784.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/EY-Reviews-E2784.htm)

## Required

For this assignment it is required to impress me :). Use [this Glasdoor.com dataset](datasets/glassdoor.csv) to create interesting/usefull visualizations with Matplotlib.

## Glassdoor dataset

The dataset consists of 438 ratings for employees of Florida offices of the 8 largest Audit firms. Reviews were downloaded summer 2017. 

Most of the variables are self-explanatory. Rating variables are between 1 (lowest) and 5 (highest).

Rating variables:

- overall_rating: Overal rating
- worklife: Rating for work-life balance
- cultule_values: Rating for culture/values
- career: Rating for career
- compensation: Rating for compensation
