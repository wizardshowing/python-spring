## Required

In this assignment you are asked to illustrate the workings of the following built-in functions that can be applied to strings:

```python
str.capitalize()
str.center(width[, fillchar])
str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])
str.find(sub[, start[, end]])
str.lstrip([chars])
str.replace(old, new[, count])
str.lower()
str.rstrip([chars])
str.strip([chars])
str.upper()
```

Assign a value to a string variable (e.g. `myText = " I eat too many apples.  "`). Then, apply each of the above functions to the string and print the output. 

Please submit your python code along with the output of the program.

> Note: As some of these functions have parameters that you can set/modify to obtain the desired output, pay careful attention to them while learning about the working of the function.
